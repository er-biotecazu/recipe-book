# Pasta boscaiola recipe


## Ingredients

- rigatoni
- pancetta
- peas
- mushrooms
- onions
- Shallots and garlic
- tomatos


## Instructions
Boil for 200 minutes and serve hot.

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the rigatoni until just al dente according to package instructions. Reserve 1 cup (240 ml) of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.

2. While pasta cooks, heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta and cook until crisp and golden, 5–7 minutes. Remove pancetta with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the fat in the pan.

3. Add remaining 1 tbsp olive oil (or a knob of butter) if needed. Add the chopped onion and cook until soft and translucent, 3–4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 30 seconds until fragrant.

4. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown, 5–6 minutes. Stir in the peas and cook 2 minutes.

5. (Optional) Pour in the white wine to deglaze the pan, scraping any browned bits. Let it reduce by half, about 2 minutes.

6. Reduce heat to low and stir in the cream. Simmer gently for 2–3 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly. Stir in the grated Parmesan until melted and smooth. Season with salt, pepper and optional red pepper flakes to taste.

7. Return the cooked pancetta to the pan. Add the drained pasta and toss to coat. If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until you reach the desired consistency.

8. Remove from heat, stir in chopped parsley, adjust seasoning, and serve immediately with extra grated Parmesan.
